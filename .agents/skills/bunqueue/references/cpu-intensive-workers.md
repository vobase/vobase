When processing CPU-heavy jobs over TCP, synchronous work blocks the event loop and can cause the TCP connection to drop, losing all in-flight jobs. This guide explains the problem and how to avoid it.

## The Problem

The TCP client sends periodic ping health checks (default: every 30s). Under heavy CPU load, the event loop can't process these pings in time. After 3 consecutive failures (~90s), the client triggers a forced reconnect, which closes the socket. When the server detects the socket close, it calls `releaseClientJobs()` and **requeues all processing jobs**. The worker then fails to ACK completed jobs with:

```
Error: Job not found or not in processing state
```

## Connection Options

Disable the ping health check and increase the command timeout:

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('heavy-queue', processor, {
  concurrency: 3,
  connection: {
    port: 6789,
    pingInterval: 0,        // Disable ping health check
    commandTimeout: 60000,  // Increase command timeout to 60s
  },
  useLocks: false,          // Avoid lock expiration under load
  heartbeatInterval: 0,     // Disable heartbeat
});
```

> **Apply the same options to Queue**
> The `Queue` and `Worker` share a TCP connection pool keyed by `host:port`. The **first** one created sets the pool options. Pass the same connection config to both:
> 
> ```typescript
> const tcpOpts = { port: 6789, pingInterval: 0, commandTimeout: 60000 };
> 
> const queue  = new Queue('heavy', { connection: tcpOpts });
> const worker = new Worker('heavy', processor, { connection: tcpOpts });
> ```

## Non-Blocking CPU Work

Even with pings disabled, long synchronous CPU work blocks heartbeats, lock renewals, and TCP responses. Break up CPU-heavy loops with periodic yields:

```typescript
// Bad — blocks event loop for entire duration
function findNthPrime(n: number): number {
  let count = 0, candidate = 1;
  while (count < n) {
    candidate++;
    if (isPrime(candidate)) count++;
  }
  return candidate;
}

// Good — yields every 500 iterations
async function findNthPrime(n: number): Promise<number> {
  let count = 0, candidate = 1, ops = 0;
  while (count < n) {
    candidate++;
    if (isPrime(candidate)) count++;
    if (++ops % 500 === 0) await Bun.sleep(0);
  }
  return candidate;
}
```

`await Bun.sleep(0)` yields to the event loop for one tick, allowing timers, TCP I/O, and heartbeats to fire.

## Default Timeouts Reference

| Setting | Default | Effect under CPU load |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| `pingInterval` | 30000ms | 3 consecutive failures → forced reconnect (~90s) |
| `commandTimeout` | 30000ms | Long-running commands timeout |
| `LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` | 5000ms | Lock expires before worker finishes |
| `stallInterval` | 30000ms | Job marked stalled if no heartbeat |

## Alternative: SandboxedWorker

For truly CPU-bound work, consider using [`SandboxedWorker`](/guide/worker/#sandboxedworker) instead. It runs each job in an isolated Bun Worker thread, so the main event loop is never blocked. SandboxedWorker supports both embedded and TCP modes, so you can use it with a remote bunqueue server without any connection tuning:

```typescript
const worker = new SandboxedWorker('heavy-queue', {
  processor: './heavy-processor.ts',
  concurrency: 4,
  connection: { port: 6789 },
});
```
